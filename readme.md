# Web Scraping Practice

This repo is my personal sandbox for learning **Python web scraping**.

## What Iâ€™ve done

- Sent HTTP requests with `requests`.
- Parsed HTML with **BeautifulSoup**.
- Saved cleaned data to CSV using `pandas`.

## Websites scraped so far

| Notebook | Site | What I pulled |
| -------- | ---- | -------------- |
| `main.ipynb` | Local `home.html` | Course titles & prices (offline demo)
| `Carousell.ipynb` | carousell.sg | Listing titles + prices
| `GeeksforGeeks.ipynb` | geeksforgeeks.org | Article headlines + code blocks
| `TalentConnect.ipynb` | nus-csm.symplicity.com | On going, confused about login
| `Cornell.ipynb` | arxiv.org | Paper title, authors, id and links
## Whatâ€™s next

- Handle multiâ€‘page scraping & scrolling.
- Experiment with JavaScriptâ€‘heavy pages using Selenium/Playwright.
- Store results in SQLite.

Iâ€™m learning as I goâ€”suggestions and PRs are welcome! ðŸ˜Š
